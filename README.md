the top menu which contain men women etc are defined in div with class name firstHeading. Class name is important as in this case css is linked ot html using  
class name

'*' is universal selector - code written inside here gets applicable to every element in the page

here we have specified box-sizing so that in later part we can add padding (spacing)

margin is set 0 - otherwise the free shippping heading will have an excessive hight

linear gradient tage used to apply change in backgrond color; here color slowly changes from black to red as we move from LHS to RHS

padding is used to put a gap between element and its border. 

The color of font used in first heading is white and text is aligned to centre so that there is equal spacing on LHS and RHS

text color is specified using white, the menu tab (which contains men, women etc) color is specifed using background-color property

postion sticky is used to ensure that tab stays in its position even if we scroll down

image is displayed using background-img, url specify the location 

background position: centre is used to ensure image which we are seeing is from center and not from any corner

background repeat : no repeat is used to sure image appear only once and not in the form of multiple tiles when tab size is reduced

postion relative is used to as a reference to calculate postion of absolute element. In this case postion of text above shoes is calculated using absolute, left and top

width: 100% ensure that all available space for a particular element is utilised 

here background color is specified using rgb values also with opacity (transparancy)
